# Containerized NixOS VM

This repository contains a proof-of-concept demonstrating how to run a NixOS virtual machine inside a container.

There is probably very little situations where doing this actually is a good idea but hey, it's funny enough :neckbeard: and still good to know. The only use case I had for this was for running a single node Nomad cluster in a devcontainers environment.
